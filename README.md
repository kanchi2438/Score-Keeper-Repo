# Score-Keeper-Repo

## What is this Repo about?🤔

Basically this rep will help you manage your score while playing games like Tic-tac-toe or Stone-Papaer-Scissors or
even to keep a count of the number of time you and your sibling have pranked each other!😁🙌

## How does it work?

There are 3 main buttons for this to work:
1. Reset Button 🔃
2. Player ☝ Score 
3. Player ✌ Score 

- Reset Button will reset the score to 0
- Player 1 button will increase the score count by +1
- Player 2 button will increase the score count by +1

## Whats behind the scenes?👀💡

This repo works purely on javascript, mostly DOM to manipulate the web elements and update the score

## What can I do?🤷‍♀️

Well you are free to fork this repo, edit it as you wish, do suggest any changes I can make and more!
